## üïπÔ∏è Overview

**RetroTone Player** is a Flash-based mobile ringtone player that brings the early 2000s era of mobile music back to life.
It interprets text-based ringtone sequences (for example: `8e2 16c2 8d2 16f2 2e2 8e2 8d2 16e2`) and plays them back as real melodies.

Originally created as a personal project (Upgraded to a web based version from my **Iutcafe project in C**), it showcased how text-encoded music data could be visualized and heard using the capabilities of **Flash MX** and **ActionScript** - long before smartphones and music apps became mainstream.
